// Convenience method:
// - sets .delegate to the UIApplication delegate (if it conforms to ILSwapServiceDelegate), and
// - calls registerWithAttributes with the dictionary at the ILSwapRegistration key of Info.plist if present, and
// - if it's a URL being opened, calls performActionsForURL: (which may call appropriate delegate methods).
// Returns YES if performActionsForURL: acted upon the URL, NO otherwise. (This allows you to ignore SwapKit-handled URLs.)

// options must be the same dictionary that is passed to application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:.

// - if an app ID is specified (non-nil), its registration will be used to send the items to it.
// - if no app ID is specified, the first app that supports receiving their item type will receive them. If there's more than one item, and there is an app that has kILAppSupportsReceivingMultipleItems is YES, it is preferred; otherwise, only the first one will be sent to the first app that supports that type, if any.
// This method will never dispatch the items to the same app that's sending them (ie this one).
// Returns YES if the item was dispatched to an app, NO otherwise.

// items is an array of property list values, NSURLs, or NSData objects of a type identified for all items by the same UTI.
// type is said UTI.
- (BOOL) sendItems:(NSArray*) items ofType:(id) uti toApplicationWithIdentifier:(NSString*) appID;

// Sends the given pasteboard to the app with the given app registration.
// This method does no checking -- it is assumed that you looked up appropriate info from the registration and checked yourself whether the app supports receiving the contents of the pasteboard (ie by looking at kILAppSupportsReceivingMultipleItems and kILAppSupportedReceivedItemsUTIs).
// Returns YES if the item was dispatched to the app, NO otherwise. (This only happens in cases of force majeoure -- eg the app does not have a URL scheme for receiving.)
