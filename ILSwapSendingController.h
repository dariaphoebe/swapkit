/**
\ingroup ILSwapKit
A ILSwapSendingController instance (a sending controller) provides a common "send to other application" user interface. Once invoked, it will search for appropriate destination applications for the given items, type and action, and present them to the user with an action sheet. Once chosen, it will send the items to that application.

Memory management is similar to UIAlertViews and UIActionSheets; you don't need to retain the instance explicitly if you just want to show it. You do have to retain it if you want to keep a reference to it alive, as per normal memory management rules.
