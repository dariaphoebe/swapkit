 The key in an item's attributes dictionary reserved for the item's original file name (a NSString). This allows applications that deal with files to name the item correctly in such contexts. If the item comes from a file and the file name is meaningful (because it was, for example, chosen by the user or transferred from another outlet where file names are meaningful such as a remote computer), then it should be included verbatim.
 
 If this attribute is present and has an extension, the app should use this extension when producing a file name for the item, favoring it over any other extension produced by the OS unless this would be undesirable for other reasons (eg. security). If this attribute is absent, the application should use the @ref kILSwapItemTitleAttribute and the information about the request's type (ILSwapRequest#type) to produce a file name, if needed.

/**
 \ingroup ILSwapKitItems
 An item is a basic "transfer unit" handled by SwapKit. A request you make will include one or more items (see ILSwapService#sendItems:ofType:forAction:toApplicationWithIdentifier:), and the receiving application will be given a ILSwapRequest object containing one or more ILSwapItem instances.
 
 ILSwapItem is a concrete class that allows access to an (immutable) #value object and to metadata (#attributes) of the object provided by the sending application. You can produce a ILSwapItem via its constructors, or use the ILSwapMutableItem subclass to produce a mutable item you can modify at will before sending it. You do not produce items for incoming requests, instead, you access them through a provided request's ILSwapRequest#item or ILSwapRequest#items properties, as appropriate.
 
 The #value object in a ILSwapitem can be any of the following:
 
 * A NSData object containing arbitrary data for the item; or
 * A NSString, containing textual data; or
 * a NSArray or NSDictionary containing property lists objects; or
 * a UIImage.
 
 You don't usually access the #value directly. Instead, you use one of the #propertyListValue, #stringValue, #imageValue, #dataValue and other accessor methods to specify how you want to access the data. (These methods will recognize and automatically convert the #value for you if inappropriate -- for example, if the #value is a NSData object containing a serialized property list, the #propertyListValue method will deserialize it for you.) It's up to you to know what accessor to use for the particular ILSwapRequest#type involved.

 \ingroup ILSwapKitItems

 A mutable item is similar to an item, but it allows modifications to its properties. You can use the <code>copy</code> method of NSObject to produce an immutable ILSwapItem copy, and ILSwapItem can produce a <code>mutableCopy</code> that responds to the messages of this class.
 
 Please note that while a mutable item with a nil #value can exist, an immutable item with a nil #value must not. Trying to produce an immutable item from such a mutable item produces, in current releases of SwapKit, an undefined behavior.

 Please note: you CAN set a UIImage as the value. It will be treated correctly, but it will be retained rather than used as the basis for a new object. This should not affect the application, since UIImages are immutable.
