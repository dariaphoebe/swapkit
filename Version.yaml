# The major and minor version. A change in major means you can find:
# - major new functionality; and/or
# - source compatibility changes
# in the new version. A change in minor has neither.
major: 1
minor: 0

# The compatibility span is an additional flag for compatibility changes.
# If it changes, then you might need to change your code!
# In stable versions, a new compatibility span means you need to revise your code.
# Beta and development versions "aim to become" this span, so there might be changes between betas despite this not changing!
compatibility_span: "A"

# Additional metadata for variants. There are three: stable, beta and development.
# Stables are identified only by major and minor. All stables have different ones.
# Betas are identified by major, minor and beta #.
# Development versions are identified by major, minor and git hash.

# The designation identifier is the number after "beta" or "development".
# For example, it's the 2 in 1.0b2. For dev versions, the identifier is '-' followed the short version of the git commit hash (eg. 1.0d-123abc).
